 * flat_linear_search_n - Finds the top-N closest matches in a flat index.
 *
 * This function performs a linear search over a linked list of indexed vectors,
 * identifying the top-N closest matches to a given query vector. The results
 * are stored in a sorted array, ensuring that the closest matches appear first.
 *
 * Steps:
 * 1. Initialize the top-N results with the worst possible match values.
 * 2. Iterate through the linked list of vectors.
 * 3. Compute the distance between the query vector and each node's vector.
 * 4. If the computed distance is among the top-N best matches:
 *    a. Shift elements to the right to maintain sorted order.
 *    b. Insert the new match in the correct position.
 * 5. Continue until all elements have been checked.

 * @param result       - Pointer to an array of MatchResult structures to store the top-N matches.
 * @param n            - Number of top matches to find.
 * @param cmp          - Pointer to the CmpMethod structure that defines the comparison functions.
